# 🪟 band 4 overlay creation

A C++ library that creates windows in high bands (band 4 / notification level) —
staying on top of fullscreen games, Task Manager, and other system windows —
with **no certificate, no protected path, no manifest required**.

## 🤔 The Problem

If you want to create a window in a high band (notifications, overlays, etc.)
so it stays on top of fullscreen games, Task Manager, and other system windows,
you would use the undocumented `CreateWindowInBand` function.

The problem is that to create windows in high bands, Microsoft requires:
- A valid certificate/signature on your executable
- Your program to be located in a protected path like `Program Files` or `System32`
- A manifest with `uiAccess=true`

And even then, your signature can be revoked depending on the purpose of your program.

## 💡 The Solution

This library solves this by injecting shellcode into `explorer.exe`, which already
has the necessary permissions, and creates the window from within it — no certificate,
no protected path, no manifest required.

## Usage
```cpp
#include "overlay/overlay.hpp"

int main(){
    overlay::init(true, &hwnd);  // true = debug output, hwnd = pointer to a HWND variable that will store the HWND of the created window
    
    // your code here
    
    overlay::exit(true);
}
```

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Must be run as Administrator.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Gets the `explorer.exe` PID via `GetShellWindow`
2. Allocates memory in `explorer.exe` with `VirtualAllocEx`
3. Writes the shellcode payload and a configuration struct into the allocated memory
4. Spawns a remote thread in `explorer.exe` via `CreateRemoteThread`
5. The thread calls `CreateWindowInBand` from within `explorer.exe`'s context, bypassing all signature and permission requirements
